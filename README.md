# Project-Pong : Final
*This repo was created from my original project due to an issue with a corrupted commit. The original project has all commits made from the beginning of the project to the final version. https://github.com/jwalk057/Project-Pong.git*

###### Youtube Video of project demonstration:

This embedded systems project was coded and wired by myself, i used a virtual machine running a distro of Ubuntu Linux that had AVR toolchain installed to easily write to my microcontroller. I coded in C from the command prompt using vim text editor and used GitHub to keep track of my files. I used an ATMEGA 1284p microcontroller, basic tactile buttons, LEDs, LED matrix, and a joystick for this project. I used multiple synchronous state machines all handled by a task scheduler for the physics of the ball, the control of the paddles, reset function, and writing out to the LED matrix.
