*This repo was created from my original project due to an issue with a corrupted commit. The original projecty has all commits made from the beginning of the project to the final version here https://github.com/jwalk057/Project-Pong.git*
Youtube Video of project demonstration:

This project was coded and wired by myself, i used a virtual machine running a distro of Ubuntu Linux that had AVR toolchain installed. I coded in C from the command prompt using vim text editor and used GitHub to keep track of my files.
